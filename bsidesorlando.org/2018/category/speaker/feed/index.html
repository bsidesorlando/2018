<p>SANS returns as one of B-Sides Orlando&#8217;s oldest Platinum sponsors. Their support over the years cannot be understated. From swag bags, lanyards, sponsorship dollars, and so much more SANS has supported B-Sides Orlando from the beginning and continue their support today.</p>
<p>SANS is a recognized leader in hands on certification for specialized areas of information security.</p>
<p>You can learn more below or click on this link: <a href="https://www.sans.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.sans.org</a></p>
<p><span id="more-447"></span></p>
<p>The SANS Institute was established in 1989 as a cooperative research and education organization. Its programs now reach more than 165,000 security professionals around the world. A range of individuals from auditors and network administrators, to chief information security officers are sharing the lessons they learn and are jointly finding solutions to the challenges they face. At the heart of SANS are the many security practitioners in varied global organizations from corporations to universities working together to help the entire information security community.</p>
<p>SANS is the most trusted and by far the largest source for <a href="https://www.sans.org/find-training/">information security training</a> and <a href="https://www.giac.org">security certification</a> in the world. It also develops, maintains, and makes available at no cost, the largest collection of research documents about various aspects of information security, and it operates the Internet&#8217;s early warning system &#8211; the <a title="Internet Storm Center" href="https://isc.sans.edu/">Internet Storm Center</a>.</p>
<h3>Computer Security Training &amp; Certification</h3>
<p>SANS provides intensive, immersion training designed to help you and your staff master the practical steps necessary for defending systems and <a title="Network Security" href="https://www.sans.org/network_security.php">networks</a> against the most dangerous threats &#8211; the ones being actively exploited. The courses are full of important and immediately useful techniques that you can put to work as soon as you return to your offices. They were developed through a consensus process involving hundreds of administrators, security managers, and information security professionals, and address both <a href="https://www.sans.org/security-awareness-training">security fundamentals and awareness</a>, and the in-depth technical aspects of the most crucial areas of <a title="IT Security" href="https://www.sans.org/it_security.php">IT security</a>.</p>
<p>SANS training can be taken in a classroom setting from SANS-certified instructors, self-paced over the Internet, or in mentored settings in cities around the world. Each year, SANS programs educate more than 30,000 people in the US and internationally. To find the best teachers in each topic in the world, SANS runs a continuous competition for instructors. Last year more than 90 people tried out for the SANS faculty, but only five new people were selected.</p>
<p>SANS also offers a <a title="Work Study Program" href="https://www.sans.org/training/volunteer.php">Work Study Program</a> through which, in return for acting as an important extension of SANS&#8217; conference staff, facilitators may attend classes at a greatly reduced rate. Facilitators are most definitely expected to pull their weight and the educational rewards for their doing so are substantial.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sans.org/security-training/bylocation">Information Security Training</a> &#8211; More than 400 multi-day courses in 90 cities around the world</li>
<li><a href="https://www.giac.org/">The GIAC Certification Program</a> &#8211; Technical certification for people you trust to protect your systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information Security Research</h3>
