<p>About SecurityMatters</p>
<p>Damiano Bolzoni, Sandro Etalle and Emmanuele Zambon, the founders of SecurityMatters, started tackling the industrial cyber security problem back in 2008. Together they developed a solution to address the domain-specific threats and needs, and in 2009 they founded SecurityMatters to bring this solution &#8211; SilentDefense &#8211; to the market. Over the following years, the tireless diligence and tight collaboration with critical infrastructure operators allowed SilentDefense to grow and be refined into the market leading solution it is today.</p>
<p>The unique knowledge and expertise of SecurityMatters were recognized by Gartner in 2014, when SecurityMatters became the first company ever nominated as a Cool Vendor for technology and service providers in the OT market.</p>
<p>Today, SecurityMatters provides critical infrastructure and industrial automation companies with best-of-class industrial cyber resilience technology that enables quick identification and recovery from threats to operational continuity. SecurityMatters has a global customer base, with partners and customers in all critical industries. These partners and customers include large multinational and defense companies, who provide a wide range of services from consultancy, systems integration and managed security services based on SecurityMatters’ products.</p>
<p>SecurityMatters has achieved great success so far and is always looking to the future. Based on continuous research and development, innovation and dedication to excellence we continue to strive and lead the way in industrial cyber resilience.</p>

<p>About iboss</p>
<p>In 2003, iboss was founded by Paul and Peter Martini. With a background in designing circuit boards, FPGAs (high speed chips), and the foundational infrastructure that built the cloud, Paul and Peter bring deep industry expertise that allows iboss to innovate and understand networking at the most fundamental levels. Their goal was to leverage this expertise to build a world-class technology company that redefined the way cybersecurity was delivered and managed.</p>
<p>Driven by their vision and passion, they bootstrapped the company and focused on building out robust product capabilities. iboss amassed scores of patents and grew organically over the next decade.</p>
<p>Back then, iboss predicted the exponential increase in bandwidth that is evident today, based on the rapidly growing popularity of mobile devices and cloud applications. The team created a revolutionary approach to solving the problems these newly distributed technologies presented.</p>
<p>As its growth accelerated, iboss began a process of global expansion and technological transformation that culminated in the introduction of its Distributed Gateway Platform<sup>TM</sup> in 2016, the world&#8217;s first web gateway as a service delivered via a unique node-based cloud architecture. Today, with more than 100 patents and patents pending, the iboss Distributed Gateway Platform protects over 4,000 organizations worldwide, making iboss one of the fastest growing cybersecurity companies in the world.</p>
